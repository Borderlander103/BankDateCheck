To run compiled program, open bash command line in folder containing "bankdatecheck".
(Note: you will probably need to create a folder "bankdatacheck" and place the .class file
in it.)
Run this command: <java bankdatecheck.BankDateCheck>.

That runs solely based of the current date/time.

To adjust the date/time for testing. Open the source file in an editor. Uncomment lines
22 and/or 23 and put in desired date or time.

Hit Ctrl+Shift+f10 to compile and run with test data.
